# Tianchi_2019_Cancer_Detection
My total work during the preliminary contest of Tianchi 2019 breast cancer detection contest

## Introduction
  Based on previous [Huaweicloud garbage classify competiton](https://github.com/lpf9562/huaweicloud_garbage_classify_competiton),I've been familiar with some information about "Great Data Sicence Competition", especially in area of CV(Computer Vision). During the previous competition, I admire Huawei Cloud AI platform--ModelArts, which made it eaier to train your own model, safer too.
"Ali Tianchi" is also a great data sicence competition net for every data fan. Sometimes it cooperats with some excellent company to release the competition and open-source data with larget amount of bonus!! As the repidly developing China internet company, it atracts so many researchers, engineers and students to join in the funny contest.The 2019 breast cancer detection contest will end its preliminary contest at 11.21. 
  At the beginning, I was not familiar with object detection technology. Since October I've been studying some fundamental model in object detection, i.e., one-stage model:You only look once(YOLO,interesting name), SSD. And two-stage model:faster RCNN.The object detection process is complex and tedious. You need extract the location of target object and then do classification and bounding box regression. So the speed of two-stage is slower than one-stage.
